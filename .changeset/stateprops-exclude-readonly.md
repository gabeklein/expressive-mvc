Exclude non-settable members from inferred JSX props.

`Component.StateProps` now drops get-only accessors and `readonly` fields from the prop surface a component accepts. These members can never be meaningfully assigned from JSX, so offering them as props only invited no-op or type-erroring assignments. Writable fields, get/set accessors, callbacks, and methods are unaffected.

The exclusion is the one structurally-detectable case (via a `readonly`-probe); TypeScript cannot distinguish a method from a callback field, so a blanket function exclusion is intentionally not attempted. The new behavior is consistent with `set`, which already rejects `readonly` keys.
