`set` now defines a reactive computed property when passed a function that takes an argument - the instruction equivalent of a class getter. `set(self => self.first + ' ' + self.last)` re-runs whenever a managed property it reads updates, receiving the instance as both `this` and its first argument. It is enumerable and read-only, matching a prototype getter.

Dispatch is by arity: a zero-arg function (`set(() => ...)`) keeps its existing behavior as a one-shot lazy factory, while a function declaring a parameter routes into the reactive compute engine. This exposes getter behavior through an instruction, so it can be composed or wrapped, and - because the property is instruction-assigned rather than a concrete getter - a subclass may refine its type with `declare`, which a generic getter on a parent class cannot express.
