<h1 id="overview-section">Overview</h1>

Classes which extend `Model` can manage behavior for components. Models are easy to extend, use and even provide via context. While hooks are great, state and logic are not a part of well-formed JSX. Models help wrap that stuff in robust, typescript controllers instead.


<br/>

## How to use

### Step 1

Create a class to extend `Model` and fill it with values of any kind. 

```js
import Model from "@expressive/react";

class Counter extends Model {
  current = 1

  increment = () => { this.current++ };
  decrement = () => { this.current-- };
}
```

### Step 2

Pick a built-in hook, such as `use()`, inside a component to make it stateful.

```jsx
const KitchenCounter = () => {
  const { current, increment, decrement } = Counter.use();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>{"-"}</button>
      <pre>{current}</pre>
      <button onClick={increment}>{"+"}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Step 3

<br/>
<h2 id="good-start">Things you can do</h2>

Everything you can do with classes naturally, can be done here. Model's simply fascilitate binding between components and the values held by a given instance.

<hr />

### Track any number of values

Models use property access to know what needs an update when something changes. This optimization prevents properties you do not "import" to cause a refresh; plus it makes clear what's being used!

```jsx
class State extends Model {
  foo = 1;
  bar = 2;
  baz = 3;
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { foo, bar } = State.use();

  return (
    <ul>
      <li>Foo is {foo}</li>
      <li>Bar is {bar}</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```
> Here, **MyComponent** will subscribe to `foo` and `bar` from a new instance of **Test**. You'll note `baz` however is not being used, and so is ignored.

<br/>

### Assign state from anywhere

State management is easy when values are held in a class.
Updates may originate from anywhere with a reference to the model. Logic can live in the class too, having strict types and easy introspection.

```jsx
class Timer extends Model {
  active = true;
  seconds = 0;

  /** use for clearInterval later */
  timer = setInterval(() => {
    if(this.active)
      this.seconds++;
  }, 1000);
}

const MyTimer = () => {
  const { is: timer, active, name } = Timer.use();

  return (
    <p>
      This timer has been active for <pre>{seconds}</pre> seconds!  
      <u onClick={() => timer.active = !active}>
        Timer is {active ? "active" : "inactive"}!
      </u>
    </p>
  )
}
```
> Reserved property `is` loops back to the instance, helpful to update values after having destructured.

<br/>

### Control components using `async`

With no additional libraries, expressive makes it possible to implement things like queries quickly and simply. Sometimes, less is more, and async functions are great for this.

```jsx
class Greetings extends Model {
  response = undefined;
  waiting = false;
  error = false;

  sayHello = async () => {
    this.waiting = true;

    try {
      const res = await fetch("http://my.api/hello");
      this.response = await res.text();
    }
    catch(){
      this.error = true;
    }
  }
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { error, response, waiting, sayHello } = Greetings.use();

  if(response)
    return <p>Server said: {response}</p>

  if(error)
    return <p>There was an error saying hello.</p>

  if(waiting)
    return <p>Sent! Waiting on response...</p>

  return (
    <a onClick={sayHello}>Say hello to server!</a>
  )
}
```

</br>

### Extend to configure
Capture shared behavior as reusable classes and extend them as needed. This makes logic is reusable and easy to document and share!

```ts
abstract class About extends Model {
  abstract name: string;
  abstract birthday: Date;
  abstract wants: any;

  happyBirthday(){
    // ...
  }
}

class AboutJohn extends About {
  name = "John Doe";
  birthday = new Date("January 1");
  wants = "a PS5";
}
```

<br/>

### Share state between components using context
Providing and consuming models is dead simple using `Provider` and `get` methods. Classes act as their own key!

```jsx
import Model, { Provider } from "@expressive/react";

class State extends Model {
  foo = 1;
  bar = 2;
}

const Parent = () => {
  const state = State.use();

  // Instance `state` is now available as its own class `State`
  <Provider of={state}>
    <AboutFoo />
    <AboutBar />
  </Provider>
}

const AboutFoo = () => {
  // Like with `use` we retain types and autocomplete!
  const { is: state, foo } = State.get();

  return (
    <p>
      Shared value foo is: {foo}!
      <button onClick={() => state.bar++}>
        Plus one to bar
      </button>
    </p>
  )
}

const AboutBar = () => {
  const { is: state, bar } = State.get();

  return (
    <p>
      Shared value bar is: {bar}!
      <button onClick={() => state.foo++}>
        Plus one to foo
      </button>
    </p>
  )
}
```
