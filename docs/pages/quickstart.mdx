Expressive MVC is architected to be as simple as possible. It's comes with very few opinions.
The main export `Model` is an (almost) empty class to handle state and reactivity under the hood.
It's designed to be extended with whatever state and logic you choose, so most actual behavior
is up to you.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@expressive/react`

  This installs `@expressive/mvc` and reexports it with a react compatibility layer.

  <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
    <Tab>
      ```bash copy
      npm i @expressive/react
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash copy
      yarn add @expressive/react
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash copy
      pnpm install @expressive/react
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Import and extend `Model`

  `Model` class is designed to be extended with whatever state and logic you choose.
  It facilitates a reactive, observable state container for your components but that it.
  The rest is up to you.

  ```js
    import Model from "@expressive/react";

    class Counter extends Model {
      current = 1

      increment = () => { this.current += 1 };
      decrement = () => { this.current -= 1 };
    }
  ```

  > Here we'll also define some methods. This isolates the logic for incrementing
  > and decrementing the counter, so it doesn't need to live in the component.

  ### Use `Counter` as a hook

  Here the `use()` method (inherited from `Model`) is hook which will create,
  memoize and subscribe to all state used by this component.

  ```js
    function Counter(){
      const { current, increment, decrement } = Counter.use();

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={decrement}>{"-"}</button>
          <pre>{current}</pre>
          <button onClick={increment}>{"+"}</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ```

  ### Place it in your app
