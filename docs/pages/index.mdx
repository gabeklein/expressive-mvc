## Overview

Classes which extend `Model` can manage behavior for components. Models are easy to extend, use and even provide via context. While hooks are great, state and logic are not a part of well-formed JSX. Models help wrap that stuff in robust, typescript controllers instead.

## Getting Started

Install with your preferred package manager

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm i @expressive/react
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @expressive/react
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm install @expressive/react
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Then within your apps:

1. Create a class. Fill it with the values, getters, and methods you'll need.
2. Extend `Model` (or any derivative, for that matter), making it reactive.
3. Within a component, use built-in methods as you would normal hooks.
4. Destructure out the values used by a component, to implicitly subscribe.
5. Update those values on demand. Components will stay synced automagically âœ¨


### A basic example

{/* <CounterExample /> */}

```js
/* Step 1:
  Import Model - This is a univeral container for your state.
*/
import Model from "@expressive/react";

/* Step 2:
  Create a class and fill it with values and methods of any kind. 
*/
class Counter extends Model {
  current = 1

  increment = () => { this.current += 1 };
  decrement = () => { this.current -= 1 };
}

/* Step 3:
  Simply use it in a component; built-in method `use()` is a hook.
  It makes the component stateful as it subscribes to a given model!
*/
const KitchenCounter = () => {
  const { current, increment, decrement } = Counter.use();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>{"-"}</button>
      <pre>{current}</pre>
      <button onClick={increment}>{"+"}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
