## Models in Context

A key feature of Expressive is the ability to share state seemlessly between components.
This process is seemless and typesafe, and is set up for you through React's context API.

```jsx
import Model, { Provider } from "@expressive/react";

class FooBar extends Model {
  foo = 1;
  bar = 2;
}

const Parent = () => (
  <Provider for={FooBar}>
    <Foo />
    <Bar />
  </Provider>
)
```

Included in the package is a `Provider` component, which takes an instance or model class as a prop.
It then makes that model available to all components which access with static [`Model.get`](/apis/model#static-get) method.

> Note: [`Model.is`](/apis/model/#method-is) here is a reference to the original state, used to update a model.

```jsx
const Foo = () => {
  // Like with `use` we retain types and autocomplete!
  const { is: shared, foo } = FooBar.get();

  return (
    <div>
      Shared value foo is: {foo}!
      <button onClick={() => shared.bar++}>
        Click increments bar
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

const Bar = () => {
  const { is: shared, bar } = FooBar.get();

  return (
    <div>
      Shared value bar is: {bar}!
      <button onClick={() => shared.foo++}>
        Click increments foo
      </button>
    </div>
  )
};
```
