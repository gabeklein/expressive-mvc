# State - Core Class

```ts
import State from '@expressive/mvc';
```

`@expressive/mvc` - framework-agnostic reactive state management built on classes.

## Creating State

```ts
class Counter extends State {
  count = 0;
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

### Instantiation

```ts
const counter = Counter.new(); // creates AND activates
const counter = Counter.new({ count: 10 }); // with initial values
```

> `new Counter()` constructs but does not activate. Use `Counter.new()` for a root instance. Bare `new` is correct for a child State declared on another State, which adopts and activates it, or when activation must be deferred deliberately.

## Properties & Reactivity

Assign class fields normally. Any property write triggers a batched update event.

```ts
class App extends State {
  name = 'World';
  count = 0;
}

const app = App.new();
app.name = 'Alice'; // queues update
app.count = 1; // queues another - both flush via microtask
```

### Presentation Transitions

Use `transition()` when model writes should present as non-urgent host work:

```ts
import { transition } from '@expressive/mvc';

transition(() => {
  app.page = 'settings';
});
```

The callback runs synchronously. Its queued subscriber callbacks retain transition priority through MVC's microtask dispatch; React interprets that priority with `startTransition`. Writes after an `await` are outside the scope and need another `transition()` call. Normal batching still applies, and urgent invalidation wins when the same watcher is already pending at transition priority.

### Value Equality

Updates are skipped when new value `===` previous value. No event is emitted.

### Property Iteration

```ts
for (const [key, value] of state) {
  // iterates managed properties
}
```

### Unmanaged Instance Data

Opaque handles - unsubscribe functions, timers, snapshots - are not reactive state: writes should not notify, nor throw thru the managed setter after destroy. TypeScript `private` does not opt out (any enumerable own field is managed); ES `#private` escapes management but re-initializes unsafely on Components. Define the field non-enumerable via `def`:

```ts
import State, { def } from '@expressive/mvc';

function put<T>(initial?: T): T {
  return def((key, self) => {
    Object.defineProperty(self, key, {
      value: initial as T,
      writable: true,
      enumerable: false,
      configurable: true
    });
  }) as T;
}

class Job extends State {
  progress = 0;                              // reactive
  unwatch = put<(() => void) | null>(null);  // unmanaged
}
```

The `def` factory returns void, so no managed property is applied. A destroyed instance is frozen - run cleanup before then: `const stop = this.unwatch; this.unwatch = null; stop?.();`. A handle only lifecycle touches stays simpler as a `new()` closure variable.

## The `is` Property

Circular self-reference. Destructure first to retain instance access alongside values, and usually alias it to the state concept (`is: counter`, `is: form`) rather than keeping a local named `is`.

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const { is: counter, count } = Counter.use();

  return <button onClick={() => counter.count++}>{count}</button>;
};
```

Also use for silent reads inside effects, or when you want to guarantee the unwrapped instance. `state.is` is always the instance whether or not `state` is a proxy. Idempotent, so `state.is.is` is safe.

```ts
// Silent read - access via `is` bypasses proxy tracking
state.get((current) => {
  console.log(current.value); // subscribes to 'value'
  console.log(current.is.other); // does NOT subscribe - silent read
});
```

## Child States

Nest states by direct assignment. Children are auto-parented, activated, and destroyed with parent.

```ts
class Parent extends State {
  child = new ChildState(); // auto-parented and activated when Parent initializes
}
```

- Replacing a child property destroys the old child (if owned).
- Non-owned children (assigned from outside) survive replacement.
- Setting a child property to `null` destroys the owned child.

## Methods

Methods are auto-bound on first access. Safe to destructure.

```ts
const { increment } = Counter.new();
increment(); // `this` is correctly bound
```

- Overwriting methods works: `test.method = () => 'bar'`.
- `super` calls work across inheritance chains.
- Methods called inside effects do NOT create subscriptions for properties they access.
- `this` inside a method is the instance, never a tracking proxy - so `this === this.is`, and it is safe as a `Map`/`Set` key or for identity comparison. True however the method was reached, including off a proxy handed to an effect or render. The `new()` hook has the same guarantee (see [lifecycle.md](lifecycle.md#the-new-hook)).

## Static Methods

### `State.new()`

Creates and activates a new instance. Accepts `State.Args` - objects (initial values), callbacks (lifecycle), strings (ID).

```ts
const test = Test.new(
  { foo: 1 }, // initial values
  (self) => {
    // lifecycle callback
    return () => {}; // cleanup on destroy
  },
  { bar: 2 } // more initial values
);
```

Arguments are processed in order. Callbacks can return:

- `() => void` - cleanup function, called on destroy
- `object` - merged as initial values
- `array` - flattened and re-processed
- `Promise` - caught and logged if rejected

### `State.is()`

Type guard. Returns true if argument is this class or a subclass.

```ts
Counter.is(SubCounter); // true
Counter.is(OtherState); // false
```

### `State.on()`

Register a callback for any instance creation of this class (or subclasses).

```ts
const stop = Counter.on(function (this: Counter) {
  // runs for every Counter instance on init
  return () => {
    /* cleanup on destroy */
  };
});
```

- Callbacks run in ancestor-first order.
- Same callback registered on parent and child runs only once.
- Returns unsubscribe function.

## Constructor Args (`State.Args`)

```ts
type Args<T> = (Args<T> | Init<T> | Assign<T> | void)[];
```

Accepts nested arrays (flattened at runtime), objects (assigned), and callbacks (lifecycle).

## Observable / Event System

State extends Observable. Also usable standalone:

```ts
import { listener, watch, event, observer, touch } from '@expressive/mvc/observable';

const stop = listener(state, (key, source) => {
  /* event */
});
const stop = watch(state, (current) => {
  /* tracked effect */
});
event(state, 'myEvent'); // manual dispatch
```

Use `observer(target, true)` to opt a custom object into the observable protocol, then use `touch(this, key, value)` in getters so `watch()` and adapter hooks can subscribe to accessed fields.

### Event Semantics

| Value                        | Means                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `true`                       | Ready / initial activation |
| `false`                      | Update flush completed     |
| `null`                       | Destroyed (terminal)       |
| `string \| symbol \| number` | Property or custom event   |

All events batched and flushed via `queueMicrotask()`.

## Context

Every active State has a "home context" that determines where its `state.get(Type)` lookups originate. `State.new()` registers to `Context.root` (the global instance) when not already claimed; `new Context(StateClass)` registers to particular context. Home is locked once assigned. Largely advanced/internal.

See [context.md](context.md) for the full Context API, global root semantics, and the `new State()` escape hatch for pre-init context placement.

Primarily consumed via the [`get` instruction](../field/get.md) and React [`Provider`](../react/react.md).

## String Representation

Each instance gets a unique identifier used by `toString()` and error messages.
